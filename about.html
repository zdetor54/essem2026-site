            <h2 class="h4">About ESSEM</h2>
            <p>The study of eye movements is of great scientific importance for a number of reasons. Experimental psychologists and neuroscientists, for example, measure eye movements to better understand cognitive processes such as visual attention and their implementation in the brain. Oculography is also applied in clinical settings, such as psychiatry and neurology, to characterise the neuropathology of various clinical conditions. Finally, eye-tracking has become an increasingly popular and widely used method of registering perceptual and attentional processing as well as behavioural preferences in applied settings such as ergonomics, (neuro-)marketing, traffic psychology and usability. Overall, the study of oculomotor control and the application of its methods is an exciting and scientifically highly productive interdisciplinary adventure.</p>
            <p>The European Summer School on Eye Movements (ESSEM) was first held in 2013 at the University of Bonn (organisers: Ulrich Ettinger, Christoph Klein; financial support by <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en" target="_blank">VolkswagenStiftung</a>). The second instalment of ESSEM was in Freiburg in 2014 (organisers: Christoph Klein, Ulrich Ettinger; financial support by <a href="https://www.bifonds.de/homepage.html" target="_blank">Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</a>), and in 2016 ESSEM took place in Athens, Greece (organisers: Nikolaos Smyrnis, Ulrich Ettinger, Christoph Klein). ESSEM 2018 was held again at the University of Bonn (organisers: Ulrich Ettinger, Christoph Klein). ESSEM 2020 took place online, hosted from the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Freiburg, Germany (organisers: Christoph Klein, Ulrich Ettinger). In September 2022, ESSEM returned to the University of Bonn (organisers: Ulrich Ettinger, Christoph Klein).</p>
            <p>ESSEM focusses on the joint elaboration of the scientific foundations of oculomotor research and its applications in clinical and industrial settings. The aim of the summer school is to bring together experienced eye movement researchers and junior scientists from different countries in order to teach the contents and methods of oculomotor research in lectures, discuss them together in discussion groups and elaborate them in depth in small groups and workshops. Content-wise, this interdisciplinary summer school deals with the (neuro)scientific bases, perceptual and cognitive components, techniques, psychophysiological correlates and biological, clinical, developmental and social aspects of eye movements as well as applications of relevant methods and findings.</p>

I enjoyed my stay enormously, I leartned a lot and I had the unique opportunity to meet with colleauges from all over the world and get to know them better. The students were really excellent and the hospitality was just great. I think everybody recognized just how much work you and your team have put into organizing this event and we are all very greatful. I think this will become a major European event in cognitive neuroscience in the years to come if our future commitment matches the standards you already set. Thanks again for your invitation"

Great lectures,a lot of learnings, and many ideas to improve our interpretation of eye movement data. It was great to be surrounded by people who finds eye movements as interestingg as I do (it is not often for me). Thanks a lot!!"
